// Two draggable knobs that show and hide the on-screen keyboard, and the
// policy for when it may show by itself.
//
// fcitx5 holds Hyprland's single input-method-v2 slot (measured -- Hyprland
// answers a second client with `unavailable`, FINDINGS.md 8.1 and 15.1), so
// no on-screen keyboard here can see which text field has focus. fcitx5 can,
// and it will tell a virtual keyboard registered with it over D-Bus; the
// daemon is that keyboard while the machine is folded. fcitx5 is not
// configured, stopped or replaced for it. The knobs stay, because some
// things a keyboard is wanted for are not text fields.
//
// The keyboard is `gimbal-sp4-oskbd` (see ../osk/). It uploads the system's own xkb
// keymap, so its keys arrive with the same keycodes as the built-in keyboard's
// and Hyprland matches binds against them without any special configuration --
// SUPER+K from the on-screen Framework key does what it does from the real
// one. It is also why AltGr and dead keys work, which is what an international
// layout needs.
//
// While the machine is folded the keyboard is a resident process, started on
// fold and killed on unfold, and showing or hiding it is a signal that maps or
// unmaps a surface it has already built: no process spawn on the path a finger
// is waiting on, and something already running for fcitx5's auto-show to
// arrive at. Laptop mode keeps the old arrangement -- SUPER+B starts it
// showing and it lives exactly as long as it is on screen -- so an unfolded
// machine carries nothing resident.

    // Press and drag to fire. There is no hold delay and no flick-versus-move
    // ambiguity to arbitrate, because moving a pad is behind a separate
    // gesture entirely: press and hold unlocks it, press and hold again sticks
    // it down. That is deliberately not something a hand does by accident,

    // the finger is a keyboard that feels slow. A hold is as deliberate as a
    // triple tap and costs the tap nothing: it acts the moment the finger
    // lifts.
